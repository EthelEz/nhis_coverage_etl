## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ([FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/index.html)) revolutionizes data exchange in healthcare, enhancing interoperability across systems. Developed by [HL7](https://www.hl7.org/), FHIR employs web technologies for seamless communication between hospitals, insurance companies ([HMOs](health-maintenance-organizations)) and Government agencies such as [NHIS Nigeria](http://www.nhis.gov.ng/), etc by aggregating data for unified patient records. It promotes interoperability among EHR systems, streamlining data access, improving care coordination, and enabling patient engagement. 

This repository demonstrates part of the [financial resources](https://darrendevitt.com/fhirs-financial-module/) in FHIR especially the relationship between `Patient, RelatedPerson, Coverage, NHIS, HMOs, and Hospitals` and emphasizes FHIR for innovative healthcare solutions, providing developers with a platform to apply programming skills for enhanced patient care and healthcare informatics transformation.

## üî• Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started, we started by using a typical sample (fake) data sent to hospitals by NHIS, performed [ETL](https://www.ibm.com/topics/etl) on this data using a typical FHIR Server, in our case, we used open-source FHIR server running locally, `http://localhost:8090/fhir`

## Prerequisites

1. Understanding of FHIR Standards:
Familiarize yourself with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard using the [FHIR Documentation](https://fhir-ru.github.io/documentation.html). However, a good knowledge of [FHIR resources RESTful APIs, searching and the principles](https://fhir-ru.github.io/search.html) of data exchange in healthcare is important.

2. Knowledge of OAuth 2.0:
[SMART-on-FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/) uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization. Gain a solid understanding of OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization in healthcare applications.

3. Development Environment:
Set up a development environment with a suitable programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java) and a web development framework.

4. FHIR Server:
Choose or set up a FHIR server to interact with FHIR resources. You can use public servers like [HAPI FHIR](http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4), or [set up your own](./docker-compose.yml).

5. Community Support: Join forums, communities, or discussion groups related to SMART Health IT and FHIR development. Engage with the community to seek guidance, share experiences, and stay updated on best practices.

## Running the FHIR Server locally

1. Download the repository to your preferred directory. 

    ``` git clone https://github.com/EthelEz/nhis_coverage_etl.git ```

2. Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Postgres](https://commandprompt.com/education/how-to-download-and-install-postgresql/) installed, then run `docker-compose up` to start the server. This will run the server locally.

3. After you must have created and run the docker file, use `Postman` or go to your browser and run `http://localhost:8090/fhir/metadata` to show you the server capabilities -- what the server can do.

## Performing ETL

1. Make sure you have `npm`, `Vue.js`, and Node.js v4 installed. If you don't have them yet installed, we recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/).

2. Ensure you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and [fhirpy](https://pypi.org/project/fhirpy/#conditional-update) for fhir data manipulation by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` file.

3. Now the FHIR API is up and running, we created a fake `NHIS-data.csv`, use the script demonstrated here to transform it to FHIR by running ```python main.py```

4. Check whether you have the data in your FHIR Server by running ```http://localhost:8090/fhir/Patient/381048-mazimusa-19900101``` 
or 
```http://localhost:8090/fhir/Coverage/381048-s198```

4. To demonstrate what happens when a `Patient` under NHIS coverage visits a `Hospital`, where the Hospital requests for `NHIS ID`, update the `identifier` in `.env` with any `NHIS ID` in `NHIS-data.csv` and run `python query_coverage.py`

##

**Please Note** You can use [Postman](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/use-postman) or any other API platform to access your server for testing purposes.
